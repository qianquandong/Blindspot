      "topicName": "Power and resources: why Arctic trade tensions keep escalating",
      "firstPrinciples": "Competition for power and scarce resources is a persistent driver of international politics. Strategic geography and critical minerals amplify rivalry, while tariffs serve as leverage to force concessions on larger issues. When nationalist, interest-first narratives rise, even traditional allies face friction.",
      "businessOpportunity": "Critical-mineral supply chain diversification advisory; geopolitical risk monitoring and hedging for multinationals; sustainable Arctic infrastructure and resource investment research for funds and strategic investors.",
      "futureRoadmap": "Next 30 days: map exposure to tariffs and critical inputs, publish a risk brief for key stakeholders, monitor multilateral forums and policy signals. Next 2 years: expect elevated competition for strategic regions and inputs; invest in traceability, alternative sourcing, and resilient logistics."

      "firstPrinciples": "Loneliness is a universal human emotion, but modern living patterns and digital-first social norms can intensify isolation. Viral content spreads collective anxiety quickly. Many \"dark\" memes are really a demand for connection, meaning, and lightweight support systems.",
      "businessOpportunity": "Privacy-first check-in and safety workflows for friends/families; community-based mental health support tooling; content and habit products that turn reactive doom-scrolling into proactive connection.",
      "futureRoadmap": "Next 30 days: test a simple check-in flow and retention loop; partner with communities; build guardrails for safety escalation. Next 2 years: expect more demand for companionship and community products; AI-assisted support will expand but must be trustable."

      "futureRoadmap": "Next 30 days: map regional risk, create incident playbooks, and run tabletop drills. Next 2 years: increased spend on adaptation, better forecasting, and growth in response tooling and insurance-aligned products."
